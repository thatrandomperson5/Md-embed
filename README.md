# Solving errors, the guide
## Basic questions

### It won't load on github!
The api is slow. Github's user content proxy will timeout. You can always freeze your request: making it so that it does not send an update request, but still sends the non-updated embed. You can do this by adding /frozen to the end of you url, like `https://md-embed-site.dragonhunter1.repl.co/api/v2/frozen?tg=example&hash=1010`

### It's not updating!
Updating can take awhile. When you get rate-limited on the api it re-directs you do the frozen version, so it won't update untill you make non-limited request.

## Error screens

### Internal Server Error 500
An issue in the code. Write an issue and give as much detail as possible

### Not a member 404 
The api couldn't locate you. make sure you have joined the discord.

### Failed to load
A accounted for error. make sure you have a vailid user and hash. If it still does not work go to **#support** on the discord.

### 403 forbidden

You are missing some key url parameters. make sure you have a user, hash and version.
